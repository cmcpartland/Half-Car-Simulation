Program: Half-Car Simulation
Version: 1.0

This program allows the user to simulate the motion of a half-car (essentially a motorcycle) as it travels over variable terrain. The user can input the car's characteristics (i.e. weight, ride height, etc.) and choose the profile of the road from a number of different selections.

System Requirements======================================================================

Windows XP and higher
Python 2.7
Pythics: https://code.google.com/p/pythics/

Operation Instructions===================================================================

Install Pythics by finding the program in the downloads section here: https://code.google.com/p/pythics/

With Pythics installed, select File > Open > select the Final.html file. The program will launch. 

The initial vehicle characteristics are intially set to reasonable values for an average family sedan, and from there they can be changed. The user can save these values into a profile to loaded in a later session.
